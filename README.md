# Janatahack-ML-in-Agriculture

Created a Machine Learning Model to classify if the Crops are being damaged or not. It is a classification problem so the models I used here are RandomForestClassifier and XGBClassifier with some Hyperparameter tuning. XGB give better results giving the accuracy of around 85% on the leaderboard
